# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project I have utilized an extended kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric.

## Environment setup
Please refer to the contents in the class. This costs me a lot of time to set the environment for C++. But I just followed what I instructed in the lecture. 

## What have been done
In this project, I have modified the following file in C++:

* FusionEKF.cpp
* kalman_filter.cpp
* tools.cpp

## Understanding the main function

I used an external software to draw the construction of the mian function.

## Simulator output

After run in the simulator, I got the following performance.
